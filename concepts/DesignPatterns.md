# Design Patterns Overview

Design patterns are proven solutions to common problems in software design. They are categorized into three main types: **Creational**, **Structural**, and **Behavioral** patterns. Below is an overview of these patterns, along with simple definitions, detailed explanations, and real-time Java Spring Boot scenarios highlighting when to use these patterns and their benefits.

## 1. Creational Design Patterns
Creational patterns focus on object creation mechanisms, providing greater flexibility and reusability.

### 1.1 Singleton
- **Definition**: Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.
- **Detailed Explanation**: The Singleton pattern is used when exactly one instance of a class is required to coordinate actions across the system. It ensures controlled access to the single instance and prevents the instantiation of multiple objects, which can lead to resource conflicts or high memory usage.
- **Scenario**: Managing a single instance of a `DataSource` bean for database connections in Spring Boot ensures efficient resource utilization and avoids creating multiple database connections.
- **Benefit**: Ensures consistency and saves resources by reusing a single instance.

### 1.2 Factory Method
- **Definition**: Defines an interface for creating objects but lets subclasses alter the type of objects created.
- **Detailed Explanation**: The Factory Method pattern is useful when the exact type of the object to be created is determined at runtime. It encapsulates the object creation process, making the system more flexible and extensible.
- **Scenario**: Implementing a `MessageServiceFactory` in Spring Boot to return `SMSService` or `EmailService` based on configuration allows you to switch between implementations without altering client code.
- **Benefit**: Promotes loose coupling between client classes and the classes they instantiate.

### 2.2 Bridge
- **Definition**: Decouples abstraction from implementation, allowing the two to vary independently.
- **Detailed Explanation**: The Bridge pattern is used to separate the abstraction from its implementation so that both can evolve independently without causing a ripple effect.
- **Scenario**: Separating different types of payment methods and payment gateways in a Spring Boot application ensures flexibility in adding new payment options.
- **Benefit**: Enhances scalability and reduces coupling between abstraction and implementation.

### 2.3 Composite
- **Definition**: Composes objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies.
- **Detailed Explanation**: This pattern is ideal for representing hierarchical structures, such as file systems or organizational charts, where individual and composite objects are treated uniformly.
- **Scenario**: Representing a hierarchical menu structure in a Spring Boot web application simplifies navigation and rendering.
- **Benefit**: Simplifies client code by treating individual and composite objects uniformly.

### 2.4 Decorator
- **Definition**: Dynamically adds responsibilities to an object without modifying its code.
- **Detailed Explanation**: The Decorator pattern is used when you want to add new behavior to an object without altering its structure.
- **Scenario**: Adding logging or security features to Spring Boot services using decorators enhances functionality without modifying the core service.
- **Benefit**: Promotes flexibility and adherence to the Open/Closed Principle.

### 2.5 Facade
- **Definition**: Provides a simplified interface to a larger body of code.
- **Detailed Explanation**: The Facade pattern is used to provide a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem, making it easier for clients to interact with the system.
- **Scenario**: Creating a `ServiceFacade` in Spring Boot to encapsulate complex interactions with multiple services simplifies client interactions.
- **Benefit**: Reduces complexity and promotes cleaner code.

### 2.6 Flyweight
- **Definition**: Reduces memory usage by sharing common parts of objects.
- **Detailed Explanation**: The Flyweight pattern is useful when many objects share common data. It ensures efficient memory usage by sharing immutable parts of objects.
- **Scenario**: Caching reusable objects like configurations or metadata in a Spring Boot application reduces memory overhead.
- **Benefit**: Optimizes memory usage and improves performance.

### 2.7 Proxy
- **Definition**: Provides a surrogate or placeholder to control access to another object.
- **Detailed Explanation**: The Proxy pattern is used to add a level of control to accessing an object, such as lazy initialization, access control, or logging.
- **Scenario**: Using a Spring `AOP` proxy for implementing method-level security or logging ensures controlled access and behavior tracking.
- **Benefit**: Promotes control and flexibility in object access.
